# My Next.js 13.4 Starter Template

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Features

This is a very simple starter template and it contains:

- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) for managing git hooks.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) very simple and easy to use library for testing.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting and keeping a constant style.
- SEO meta configs ready (change with your own website info).
- Folder structure (this is my personal preference).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
