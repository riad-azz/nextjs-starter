# My Next.js 13.4 Starter Template

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Features

This is a very simple starter template and it contains:

- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) Managing git hooks.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) Simple and easy to use library for testing.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) Code formatting and keeping a constant style.
- [Next-Themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-themes) Dark & Light themes.
- SEO meta configs ready (change with your own website info).
- Folder structure (this is my personal preference).

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
```

run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

run all tests:

```bash
